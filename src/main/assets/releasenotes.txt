=============
Version 1.3.4

- New Engine Feature:
    - Precise contact normal calculation - can be enabled via compile switch
    - Dynamic iteration count. The constraint iteration can be set to dynamic, aborting when all constraints are satisfied. 
    
- Engine Modification:
    - Interface changes to make constraint iteration counts and timestep part of the world instead of static. 
    - Timestep is not longer static, so that multiple worlds cnaa use different simulation parameters. 
    - Interface change: applyAcceleration takes the tiemstep as argument
    - Add mode to motors that can remove orthogonal movement
    
- Engine Bug Fix: 
    - Clean up contacts completely, when they are reused for different body collision. 
    - Friction could in some situations cause bodies to jump due to uninitialized contact loop values. 
    
=============
Version 1.3.3

- Designer Bug Fix: 
    - landscape is not displayed correctly in tree view
    - worlds with script could sometimes fail loading

- new feature:
    - new event type:  relative collision
    - added utility method to convert angle2FX to degrees
    
- Engine Bug fix: 
    - bodies that are non-affected by gravity do not interact properly. 
    - contact assignment from one step to another could be wrong causing wrong bouncing behaviour.
    - script removal did not remove the entire script
    - body collision events sometimes did not return the correct contact body
    
=============
Version 1.3.2

- Engine Bug Fixes:
    - AABB calculation incorrect, fixes potential tunneling error with landscapes
    - static body loading
    - collision: particle - circle: wrong position correction (was a little overcompensating)
    
    - performance boosts
    
- Designer features:
    - display AABB

=============
Version 1.3.1

- Engine Bug fixes:
    - Joint copy creates correct reference
    - Shape filtering for events working correctly 
    - collision of bodies with center of gravity not in the origin: correct collision face determination
    
- Engine features:
    - event triggering: Contact events return the triggering contact, instead of the body. 
    - bodies have additional flags: 
        - not affected by gravity: gravity force does not apply to this body
        - not interacting: the body is not considered for collision with other bodies

	- improved interface:
        - contact allows impulse inspection
        - additional setters/getters
        
    - additional flags for the bodies:
        - not affected by gravity, can be used for floating bodies, that still behave physically
        - not interacting with other bodies, can be intersting in combination with other constraints
        
    - added event type: collision sensor, collisions with a body sensor can be detected. 
        The body is not part of the physical world and represents a sensor. 

=============
Version 1.3.0
- Engine features:
    - True multishape support. This allows to create convex shapes. 
    - Bug fix: corrected inertia calculation, improving stacking in particular for long bodies
    - Improve collision detection and response: collision lookahead allows non-penetration (except for complicated situations)
    
- Designer:
    - multishape support

    
=============
Version 1.2.1
- Engine features:
    - performance
    - userdata for bodies and shape
    
- Designer:
    - level management

=============
Version 1.2.0
- New features:
    - particles : complete treatment of particles, including collision with other bodies in the world
    - motor: relative movemet is possible

- Designer: 
    - world view
    
=============
Version 1.1.1
- Bug fixes:
    #5 	Bouncing with elasticity of 1.0 wrong 	
    A falling ball with an elasticity of one can bounce higher up than it was initially dropping from.
    
    #4 	Body Joints can cause instability 	
    If the joint is placed far off from both object centers, instabilities can occur
    
    #3 	Gravity settings do not work 	
    Changing gravity in the world designer does not have an effect in the simulation. 

- Designer
  - Features:  
    - nicer handling: interaction elements retain size while zooming
    - Area events can be modified with the mouse
    - Undo history
    - Saving/loading of shapes improved
  
=============
Version 1.1.0
  
- Engine:
  - Features:  
    - new shape identification handling: ShapeSet
      - note: use shapes only in one world!
    - new event identification handling: EventSet
    - events can be set to trigger only once, when they are active the first time
    - landscape can use the colission flags as well
    - landscape faces
    - new contact overlap correction: concept loosely based on split impulses
    - events can be set to trigger once
    - API changes: mass is associated with shape, not body
  - Bugs:
    - incorrect collision detection for some border cases: objects with narrow edges
    - fix joint are sometimes unstable
    - centroid computation -> overflow
    
- Designer: 
  - Features: 
    - multi selection
    - load background image, to design shapes and world around an image    
  - Bugs: 
    - saving springs was incorrect
    - moving pin joints
    - remove shapes completely
    
- A true floating point version of the engine is supplied. 
  This library gives better results for mobiles with hardware floating point support.
